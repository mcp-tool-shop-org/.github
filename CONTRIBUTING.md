# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve MCP Tool Shop.

## Quick start
- Keep changes focused and small.
- Prefer links to authoritative docs.
- Update both `profile/README.md` and `llms.txt` when changing positioning, tool lists, or architecture diagrams.

## Docs quality gates (CI)
PRs run:
- Markdown lint
- Link checking

If you need to temporarily ignore a flaky link, add it to `lychee.toml` exclusions with a short comment.

## Release / announcements
- Use consistent naming: **MCP Tool Shop**, and tool names as in badges.
- Keep badge links and the “Ecosystem Architecture” section in sync.
