# .github: how it works

Mapped at 2026-09-30 from commit d05c730 by Atlas 1.24.0.

## What this is

This is the organization's profile page and the community-health files its repositories inherit. 8 parts, in JavaScript (4 files), Astro (1 file), CSS (1 file), Python (1 file), TypeScript (1 file) and shell (1 file). Work enters through 4 doors; the busiest is Org Drift Guard, which reaches 3 parts. It deploys a site to GitHub Pages. Other repositories use the Delta dependency audit action.

## What changed since 2026-09-25 (f4a5220)

- Delta dependency audit (.github/actions/delta-audit/action.yml) is a new action other repositories use. It runs .github/actions/delta-audit/delta-audit.mjs.
- brand/previews/_tmp_Attestia-Desktop.svg is now written by brand/generate-previews.py.
- brand/previews/_tmp_ConsensusOS.svg is now written by brand/generate-previews.py.
- brand/previews/_tmp_InControl-Desktop.svg is now written by brand/generate-previews.py.
- And 21 more new writers and readers of places.
- 2 files changed content, across 2 parts.

## What comes in

1. **Org Drift Guard.** On a pull request touching 8 paths; or by hand. Checks CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE and 10 more.
2. **Docs Quality.** On a pull request touching 3 paths; on a push to main touching 3 paths; or by hand. Runs scripts/check-catalog.mjs.
3. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
4. **Delta dependency audit** (an action other repositories use). Runs .github/actions/delta-audit/delta-audit.mjs.

## What happens through Org Drift Guard

1. The workflow checks brand/README.md, brand/og/manifest.json and brand/palette.md in brand, 5 files in docs, and 5 files in the repository root.
2. It reads other repositories through the GitHub API.

## Who reads the results

Org Drift Guard writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Docs Quality** runs scripts/check-catalog.mjs, lints Markdown with markdownlint-cli2, and checks links with lychee.

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, and deploys the site.

**Delta dependency audit** (an action other repositories use) runs .github/actions/delta-audit/delta-audit.mjs and runs git.

## What breaks what

No part is imported by another part, and no part sits on the path of two doors.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since 0 source files reach 10 revisions; the floor rises to 10 when 25 do.

## What no test touches

No test files were found by name.

## Written but never read

Every written place has a reader.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

- **docs/catalog.yaml** is written by scripts/build-catalog.mjs.

## Hand-authored

People write .github/, assets/, brand/, profile/, the repository root and site/. Nothing in this repository writes to them.

## Where to start

.github/workflows/docs-quality.yml → scripts/check-catalog.mjs → docs/catalog.yaml → scripts/build-catalog.mjs

Read those in order to follow one pull request end to end. This path follows Docs Quality, since Org Drift Guard runs no code this map can follow.

## What this map cannot see

- 12 writes go to places this repository does not track, so they are not listed as generated.
- 1 write goes to a temporary directory, not to this repository.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 25 source files reach 10 revisions in the window.

Regenerate with `npx --yes @dogfood-lab/atlas map`.
